    Chapter 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development
    of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their
    performance on a specific task through experience.

    The field of machine learning has grown exponentially in recent years, driven by
    advances in computing power, the availability of large datasets, and improvements
    in algorithmic techniques.

    Chapter 2: Types of Machine Learning

    There are three main types of machine learning:

    1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn a mapping function
    2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples
    3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through interaction with an environment

    Each type has its own strengths and is suitable for different kinds of problems.
